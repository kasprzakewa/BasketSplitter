# What Is BasketSplitter?
Say goodbye to receiving multiple small packages for individual items! BasketSplitter is an **intelligent delivery management** library designed to **minimize the number of deliveries** while ensuring that your purchases reach your doorstep swiftly and efficiently. Whether youâ€™re a seasoned bargain hunter or a time-strapped executive, this algorithm ensures that your items are bundled together in the most optimal way.

# Using BasketSplitter: A Step-by-Step Guide

<h3>Warning</h3>

- Make sure you have **Java 17** or higher version to avoid "Major-Minor Version" issue.

<h3>Method 1: Building from Source</h3>

<h4>Clone the Repository:</h4>

- First, navigate to the BasketSplitter repository on GitHub.
- Click the **<> Code** button to copy the repository URL.
- Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

  ```console
  git clone <repository_url>
  ```

Replace **<repository_url>** with the actual URL you copied.

<h4>Build the Project:</h4>

- Change into the cloned repository directory:
  ```console
  cd BasketSplitter/basket-splitter
  ```
- Run the following Maven command to build the project:

  ```console
  mvn clean package
  ```

- This will generate a **basket_splitter.jar** file in the target directory.
  
<h4>Usage:</h4>

- You now have the **basket_splitter.jar** file.
- Incorporate it into your projects by adding it to your classpath.
- Use the **BasketSplitter** objects in your code.

<br>
<h3>Method 2: Direct Download (Quick and Easy)</h3>

<h4>Download the JAR File:</h4>



- If you prefer not to build from source, you can directly **download** the **basket_splitter.jar** file from the repository.
- Look for the file in the repositoryâ€™s **code section**.

<h4>Integration into Maven Project:</h4>

If youâ€™re working with a Maven project:

- Open your **terminal** or **command prompt**.
- Run the following command, replacing **<path_to_jar>** with the actual path to the downloaded JAR file:

  ```console
  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=<path_to_jar> -DgroupId=com.ocado.basket -DartifactId=basket_splitter -Dversion=1.0.0 -Dpackaging=jar
  ```

- Add the following dependency to your projectâ€™s **pom.xml**:

  ```XML
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.ocado.basket</groupId>
    <artifactId>basket_splitter</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
  </dependency>
  ```

<br>
<h4>Basic Java App:</h4>

If youâ€™re working with a basic Java application:


- **Compile** your Java code along with the **basket_splitter.jar**:

  ```console
  javac -cp <path_to_jar> Your_App.java
  ```

- **Run** your application:

  ```console
  java -cp <path_to_jar> Your_App.java
  ```
<br>

And thatâ€™s it! Youâ€™re all set to use **BasketSplitter** in your projects. If youâ€™d like to see an **example app**, itâ€™s available in the **examples** directory.

# Set Cover Problem for Intelligent Delivery Distribution

<h3>Problem Context</h3>

In our project, weâ€™ve developed an algorithm that **optimizes** the **delivery process** for online stores. The goal is to efficiently distribute products from a customerâ€™s shopping basket while **minimizing the number of deliveries**. Imagine a scenario where a customer orders multiple items, and our system needs to decide how to pack and deliver those items in the most effective way.

<h3>The Set Cover Problem</h3>

The Set Cover Problem serves as the backbone of our intelligent delivery distribution algorithm. Hereâ€™s why weâ€™ve chosen this problem:

- **Coverage Efficiency:** Just like covering all elements in a universe, our application aims to **cover all the products** in a customerâ€™s order. Each product corresponds to an element, and the sets represent products that can be delivered via the same method.
- **Minimizing Deliveries:** By selecting the **smallest sub-collection** of sets (i.e., delivery options), we ensure that the customer receives all their items in as few deliveries as possible. This directly aligns with our projectâ€™s objective of optimizing the delivery process. 

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

**Given:**

- A **universe** of elements (often denoted as $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$).
- A collection of **subsets** (sets) whose union covers the entire universe.
<br>
The task is to identify the smallest sub-collection of sets whose union equals the universe. In other words, we want to find the most efficient way to cover all elements while minimizing the number of selected sets.

<h4>Example:</h4>

Letâ€™s illustrate the problem with a simple example:

**Universe:**
<br>

  ```math
  U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
  ```
<br>

**Collection of sets:**
<br>

  ```math
  S = \{ \{1,2,3,6\}, \{1,2,4\}, \{3,4,5\} \}
  ```
<br>

Clearly, the union of all sets in S covers the entire universe U. However, we can achieve the same coverage using only **two sets**: 
<br>

  ```math
  \{ \{1,2,3,6\}, \{4,5\} \}
  ```
<br>
Therefore, the solution to the set cover problem in this case has a size of 2.

# Features
<h3>1. Config File Loading</h3>

- The configuration file (in **JSON** format) should contain a list of **items** that can be **delivered**.
- Next to each item, the configuration file should list the available **delivery options**. These options define how the item can be delivered. For example:

   ```json
  {
    "Strawberries": [
       "Pick-up Point",
       "Courier"
     ],
    "Dining table": ["Courier"]
  }
   ```
  In this configuration:
  
  - **Strawberries** can be delivered either via a **Pick-up Point** or by **Courier**.
  - **The Dining table** is exclusively available for delivery through the **Courier** service.

<h3>2. Basket Optimization</h3>

- Load a shopping basket from a separate **JSON** file. The basket includes the **items selected** by the user. For example:

  ```json
  [
    "Strawberries",
    "Dining Table"
  ]
   ```
  
- BasketSplitter will intelligently **group items** from the basket to minimize the number of deliveries.

<h3>3. Output File Saving</h3>

- After optimization, BasketSplitter saves the **optimized basket** to an output **JSON** file. This file contains the grouped items and their delivery details. For example:

   ```json
  {
    "Courier": [
      "Strawberries",
      "Dinning table"
    ]
  }
   ```
  
<h3>4. Format</h3>

- **JSON Compatibility:** All input and output files (config, basket, and output) must be in JSON format, using pattern specified earlier.
